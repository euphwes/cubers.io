## Features

### Visually pleasing UI

See a list of all events being held during this week's competition, as well as indications to which events you have completed and which events are in-progress. If you are logged-in, all progress is saved automatically.

Clicking on an event brings you to a timer, where you can see the scrambles for the event as well as a scramble preview image for supported event. Times are recorded for you to track your progress, and a menu is available for administration of time solve penalties.

If you prefer to use another timer and manually enter your times, there is an option to skip the timer and input times directly.
